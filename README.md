# Tutorial

This tutorial addresses key challenges in the creation of diverse workflows that are portable, repeatable, and performant. We present the [ExaWorks](https://exaworks.org) SDK, and its constituent components: [Parsl](https://parsl-project.org/), [RADICAL-Cybertools](https://radical-cybertools.github.io/) (RCT), [Swift/T](https://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html), and [Flux](http://flux-framework.org/). These components are widely used, and available tools for developing workflow applications. This tutorial outlines modern workflow motifs on HPC platforms (e.g., ensemble campaigns, ML-in-the-loop), illustrates science examples of these motifs, and discusses solutions using the ExaWorks SDK.

## Overview

We first introduce the ExaWorks component tools and explain their key capabilities. Through common workflow motifs and their instantiation, we  describe common challenges and best-practices for developing and deploying HPC workflows.
